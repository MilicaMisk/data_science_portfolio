# Kaggle's Time Series Forecasting Competition

### [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting)

The objective of this competition is to utilize time-series forecasting techniques to predict store sales based on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a prominent Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.

**Goal of the Competition:**
The primary goal of this competition is to build a robust model that can accurately predict the unit sales of thousands of items sold across different Favorita stores. By analyzing the training dataset, which includes information such as dates, store details, item specifics, promotions, and unit sales, participants are encouraged to apply their machine learning skills to create precise forecasts.

**Context:**
Forecasting plays a crucial role not only in meteorology but also in various other domains. Governments rely on forecasts to predict economic growth, while scientists attempt to anticipate future population trends. For businesses, particularly brick-and-mortar grocery stores, accurate forecasting is essential to manage inventory effectively. An overestimation could lead to surplus perishable goods, while underestimation may result in popular items quickly running out, leading to revenue loss and dissatisfied customers. Machine learning, with its ability to provide more accurate predictions, offers a solution to this challenge faced by retailers.

Traditional forecasting methods in the retail sector often lack sufficient data to support their accuracy and are usually not automated. As retailers expand to new locations with distinct requirements, introduce new products, adapt to changing seasonal preferences, and implement unpredictable marketing strategies, the forecasting problem becomes even more complex.
For grocery stores, improved accuracy in forecasting can significantly reduce food waste related to overstocking and enhance overall customer satisfaction. As a result of this competition's findings, local stores may eventually be better equipped to provide precisely what customers need during their shopping experiences.
